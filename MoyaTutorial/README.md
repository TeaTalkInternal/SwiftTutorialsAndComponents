# MoyaTutorial

Moya is a Swift Network Abstraction Library. It provides us with an abstraction to make network calls without directly communicating with Alamofire


Here we have a simple project built using Moya. Here UserNetworkService.swift file holds most of the abstraction that Moya offers. Please feel free to use it.

To make it much simpler we have placed UIButton for each of the service calls like Insert, Delete, Update and Display List users.

A simple server (using php and mysql) is set up at http://teatalk.one/moya_user/

This will help you to be focused onkly using Moya and how requests are made. (Need not worry about server)

Do run "pod install" before using this project.
